Enable SSL to redirect all pages to SSL and load all resources over SSL.

== Description ==

A simple and easy to use WordPress SSL plugin which will redirect all non-SSL pages to SSL and ensure that all resources on your SSL pages are loaded over SSL as well.

It includes a user-friendly setup wizard upon activation to check if SSL is supported on the hosting/server before it allows the SSL to be enabled and that ensures that the website doesn't become inaccessible if SSL is not supported.

= Plugin Features =

* Check if SSL is supported on hosting/server
* Enable SSL with a single click
* Redirects all non-SSL URLs to https://
* Converts all non-SSL resources (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) to https:// on pages
* Redirect to non-SSL if SSL is not enabled

See our <a href="https://tribulant.com/docs/one-click-ssl-plugin/11098">online documentation</a> for more details and detailed instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is SSL? =

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and it is a protocol which encrypts all data in transit on your website to prevent theft, interception or hacking.

= What is required to use SSL? =

You need to have SSL support on your hosting/server. This is done by installing an SSL certificate.

= Is SSL mandatory? =

No it is not but for the security and peace of mind of your users, it is highly recommended. Many modern day browsers are warning users about insecure websites these days.

== Screenshots ==

1. Testing utility to check if SSL is supported on the hosting so that the website doesn't become inaccessible.
2. Easily enable SSL with a single click after confirming SSL support.
3. If you are already on SSL (https://) the plugin will tell you that and no action is required.
4. Configure your SSL to run on specific sections and behave in a certain way as required.
